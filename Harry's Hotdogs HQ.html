<p> Here is a paragraph for no reason other than to exercise the skill of creating elements in html, which stands for hyper text markup language. To utiilize an
element we first need to figure out what kind of element we want to use. We then take said element and and create an opening and closing bracket with which we 
can cram the used data inbetween. An example of said thing can be found below. </P> 
<p> &lt;p&gt; The data placed within the opening and closing bracket is affected by the element &lt;/p&gt; </p>
<p> Below is the list of ingredients we need to be able to make the hotdogs. </p> 
<h1> HotDog Ingredients: </h2> 
<ol>
	<li> Pork and various chunks of leftover meat. </li> 
	<li> Harry's Hotter Than Heck Hotdog sauce </li> 
	<li> Hotdog buns </li> 
	<li> Any other conidemnts that you may want to put on a hot dog (: </li> 
</ol>
<!--- Hello, this is simply a goofy site for me to test my skills in and nothing more, Thank you! --->
<p> Below is a table, this can be created using the &lt;table&gt; element. We can also color paragraphs green by using in-text CSS even though
 we probably shouldn't most of the time. we do this by adding " style='color:green;' " inside the first p bracket for the element "paragraph". However
we have decided to link externally with CSS so as to to make all of the "paragraph" elements appear a certain color. Generally as a rule of thumb it is better
to link to an external piece of CSS using a url or linking directly if it is in the same directory. </p> 
<p> The rows are designated with the &lt;tr&gt; element. However, it is best not to use inline CSS and instead to link externally. </P> 
<p> header rows are designated with the &lt;th&gt; element. Further more, it is important to add closing brackets for both of these elements, 
as said element is not an exception to the rule of brackets needing to be closed. An important exception to this that is frequently used when coding 
websites is the &lt;img&gt; element. If you understand html or have practiced it to the point of understanding the basic syntax of the language then you
will know that &lt;img&gt; stands for image. Otherwise you probably used simple heurestics to figure it out...good for you! </p> 
<h1> <strong> Good and BAD sauces for Hotdogs: </strong> </h1> 
<table align="left" width=50% border=1> 
<!--- Please note, this is deprecated code, normally CSS is used to achieve the border, width, and allignment attributes. However it is nonetheless 
important to know these so you can troubleshoot the coding of others should you need to. END NOTE. --->
